## Hi! Welcome to taxi driver case solution
This repository created for teknasyon taxi driver case.

Repository originnaly designed to work with gcp. In addition to that to see full outcome of etl flow, linux vm or cloud composer needed!

### **Methods**
This porject based on GCP that's why we need to open a new gcp account. But don't worry google gives 300$ credit. 
After opening the account follow these steps:

* Open Bigquery and create dataset for your project. In the code "teknasyon-340116.taxi_ds". Project and dataset should change for your creds.
